    <h1>Expounder</h1>

    <h2>Motivation</h2>

    <p>
    Expounder is a very small JS/CSS library that lets article writers hide text
    behind a link, and allows readers to click that link to expand the text.  It
    is born out of some frustration I had when reading tutorials and other
    books. I would frequently be familiar with one part of the source material,
    but have no way to skip it and only read the parts I was unfamiliar with. I
    thought that HTML was too powerful for this to not be a thing, so I spent a
    few minutes writing up a simple prototype implementation.
    </p>

    <p>
    Expounder is for authors of mainly educational articles and texts who want
    to save readers time and preserve their attention by allowing them to select
    exactly what they want their text to elaborate on. Usually, tutorials go
    into great detail without giving you an option. Expounder allows authors to
    only expose a high-level view of the topic to their audience, and enable the
    latter to select what they need to read more about. This is done in a very
    natural way that preserves cohesion with the rest of the text.

    <h2>An example</h2>

    <p>
    The best way to explain what Expounder does is with a demo. Here is a sample
    that uses Expounder (click the dashed-underlined links to read more on a
    topic):
    </p>

    <div class="expounder-example">
        Quantum mechanics (QM; also known as quantum physics or quantum theory)
        including <span data-expounder="qft">quantum field theory</span><span
            data-expounded="qft"> (a theoretical framework for constructing
            quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics
            and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics)</span>, is
        a fundamental branch of physics concerned with processes involving, for
        example, <span data-expounder="atom">atoms</span> and <span
            data-expounder="photon">photons</span>.  <span
            data-expounded="atom">An atom is the smallest constituent unit of
            ordinary matter that has the properties of a chemical element.[1]
            Every solid, liquid, gas, and plasma is composed of neutral or
            ionized atoms.</span> <span data-expounded="photon">A photon is an
            elementary particle, the quantum of all forms of electromagnetic
            radiation, including light. It is the force carrier for the
            electromagnetic force, even when static via virtual photons.</span>
        In such processes, said to be quantized, the action has been observed to
        be only in integer multiples of the <span data-expounder="planck">Planck
            constant</span><span data-expounded="planck">, a physical quantity
            that is exceedingly, indeed perhaps ultimately, small</span>. This
        is utterly
        inexplicable in <span data-expounder="classical">classical
            physics</span><span data-expounded="classical">, which refers to
            theories of physics that predate modern, more complete, or more
            widely applicable theories</span>.
